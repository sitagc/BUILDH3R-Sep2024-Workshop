# Discord Use Case 

## zkMIPS for Private Financial Audits
### Problem
Financial institutions are regularly audited to ensure compliance with government regulations and internal financial controls. However, disclosing all financial records to auditors can expose sensitive business data and trade secrets.

### Solution: zkMIPS-Based Private Financial Audits
Using zkMIPS, financial institutions can generate proofs that verify financial compliance without revealing confidential records. This allows companies to perform audits securely and privately, while auditors can verify the results without accessing sensitive internal data.

- Data Processing:
  Financial records (e.g., income statements, balance sheets) are processed by a zkMIPS program, which generates a proof showing:
    - Compliance with accounting standards.
    - No irregularities in financial transactions.
    - The proof doesn’t reveal sensitive financial data.

- Proof Submission:
  The proof is submitted to an on-chain verifier contract, allowing auditors to:
    - Verify that the company’s financials are compliant.
    - Ensure regulatory and internal audit standards are met.
- Audit Reports:
  Auditors can generate reports based on the zkMIPS proof without needing to see sensitive transaction-level data, protecting the company’s confidentiality.

### Why zkMIPS for Financial Audits?
- Confidentiality: Businesses can keep proprietary financial data private while proving compliance.
- Efficiency: zkMIPS allows for faster, automated verification without manual inspection of sensitive records.
- Trust: Regulators and auditors can trust the validity of the proof without accessing confidential information.

### Solution Components
- zkMIPS: Generates cryptographic proofs that verify financial compliance without revealing sensitive data.
- Smart Contract: On-chain verifier contract ensures the financial proof is valid.
- Golang & Rust: Used to build the zkMIPS audit program for financial data.
